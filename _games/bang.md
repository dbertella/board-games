This is probably the first game in my collection. It was back in 2010. With a friend I was hitchiking in the US and a man offered us a ride.
We were in San Francisco and the guy was supposed to take us few km but then he decided to take us to our final destination Santa Cruz. We discussed about boardgames and at the end of the ride he decided to give me this just because I told him was one of my favourite games at the time and he happened to have this exact game in the car at that time! That was amazing! I literally couldn't believe this! That was so nice. And I would say this is where this journey begins.
